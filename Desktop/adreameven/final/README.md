"PHP scripting is definitely one of the easiest, if not the easiest scripting language to
learn and grasp for developers. This is partially due to the similarities PHP syntax has
with C and Java. Even if the only knowledge of development that you have is with HTML, picking
up PHP is still fairly easy. For developers just starting out, PHP is often the first
scripting language they learn because it's clear and easy to understand." - PJ Taei
